# DigitalBank

A CRUD app that simulates a bank with several functionalities, such as transfer, mobile recharge, deposit, billing other users and editing the user's profile, including adding images. The app was developed entirely in Java, using concepts such as MVVM, Adapters, masks and a non-relational database (Firebase), Picasso library for using images.
